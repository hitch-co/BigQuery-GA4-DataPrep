### Next Steps

### PROJECT:
## Columns: Create analytical function for applying session level attribution

# Session Attributed

TODO: 
    - OPTIONAL, capture the session #
    - OPTIONAL, capture the hit #
    
COMPLETE: 
    - capture the source/medium/campaign where hit number = 1 and NOT NULL
        - Accomplished by taking the first known value of source/medium/name per session

# First Visit Attributed
- Contained in the defacto traffic_source columns

# Algorhithmic (overwrite rules)
- Find a way to do this... be creative

### LEARNING:
## Parse nested json
Items record includes json, but nothing is nested. Show example columns for the following:
- Extracting a sum of revenue
- Extracting a count of items
